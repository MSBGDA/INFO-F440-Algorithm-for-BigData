    "# Count min sketch\n",
    "\n",
    "We are in the streaming model, and data is passing by, and each data item $x$ has an ID. Suppose we want to know, given an ID, what is number of times data with that ID has appeared in the stream, call this $c_x$? In order to answer this exactly, we would need to store a table of all ID's we have seen as well as the number of times we have seen this. Suppose we are willing to have an approximate answer, and in return have a very small structure. That is where the count-min sketch is of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The count min sketch, given values of $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$ will for any item $x$ compute an approximate frequency $\\hat{c}_x$ such that $c_x \\leq \\hat{c}_x$ and $\\hat{c}_x \\leq c_x + \\epsilon n$ with probability at least $1-\\delta$, where $n$ is the number of items seen so far. Thus the answer given may overestimate the frequency, but it will never underestimate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The count-min sketch is a 2-dimensional array $A$ with width $w=2/\\epsilon$ and height $h=\\log \\frac{1}{\\delta}$. This is the entire structure. It thus has size $\\frac{2}{\\epsilon}\\log \\frac{1}{\\delta}$. We assume we have $h$ hash functions $hash_i$, $i \\in [h]$. The two operations are increment and query:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $Increment(x)$: For all $i \\in [h]$, increment $A[i][hash_i(x)]$\n",
    "- $Query(x)$: For all $i \\in [h]$, return the smallest $A[i][hash_i(x)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets prove that it works as claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X_{x,j}$ be $A[i][hash_i(x)] - c_a$, that is, the number of excess items in the $i$th row for item $x$, those beyond $c_a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know $E[X_{x,i}] \\leq n/w$, as less than $n$ items have been added that are not $x$ and each has a probability of $1/w$ of incrementing the same bucket as $i$. Thus by Markov $Pr[X_{x,i} \\geq \\overbrace{2n/w}^{n\\epsilon}] \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$. (Note these events are *not* independent but Markov is ok with that).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the chance that a single value is above the desired error threshold of $n\\epsilon$. But as we use the min, failure occurs when *all* $h$ locations have above the desired error threshold. Each row is computed independently, so we can just multiply, and you get that this happens with probability at most $\\delta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Pr\\left[ \\bigwedge_{i=1}^h [X_{a,i} \\geq n\\epsilon] \\right] \\leq \\frac{1}{2^h} = \\delta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus you can get a value, accurate to within $1\\%$ additive error, with $1\\%$ failure probability using an array of size $2000$.\n",

Show how to modify the class above so that a method `mostFrequent()` can be added that reports the words with frequency above $2\\epsilon n$. Most importantly, you can not store all the words!
